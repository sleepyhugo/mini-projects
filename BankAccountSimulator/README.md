# Bank Account Simulator (C++)

A simple command-line bank account simulator written in C++.  
This project was built to practice core C++ fundamentals like functions, loops, conditionals, and basic input validation.

## Features
- Deposit money into an account
- Withdraw money with insufficient funds protection
- Check current balance
- Menu-driven CLI interface
- Runs continuously until the user exits

## Concepts Used
- Functions
- While loops
- Conditional logic (`if / else`)
- User input/output
- Basic error handling
- State management (account balance)

## How to Run

Compile:

```g++ "BankAccountSimulator\bankAccountSimulator.cpp" -o bank```

### Run:

``` ./bank ```

## Purpose

This mini project is part of my C++ learning journey and focuses on building small, 
complete programs that demonstrate steady progress and understanding of fundamentals.
