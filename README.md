# 🧪 C++ Mini Projects

A collection of small C++ command-line projects created to practice and improve my understanding of core C++ concepts.

This repository focuses on building simple, complete programs rather than large frameworks. Each project is kept intentionally small to highlight specific fundamentals and track learning progress over time.

## Projects

Each project lives in its own folder and includes a short README explaining what it does and what concepts it covers.

Examples include:
- CLI Calculator
- Bank Account Simulator
- Dice Rolling Simulator
- Battleship Game
- Other small utilities and games

More projects will be added as I continue learning C++.

## What I’m Practicing
- Functions
- Loops and control flow
- User input and output
- Conditional logic
- Basic error handling
- State management
- Random number generation
- Writing clean, readable C++ code

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is consistent hands-on practice and visible progress while learning C++.
These projects are intentionally simple and focus on fundamentals that can be built upon later.
