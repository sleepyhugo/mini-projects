# String Analyzer (C++)

A simple command-line program written in C++ that analyzes a sentence entered by the user.

This project was created to practice basic string handling, loops, and conditional logic in C++.

## Features
- Reads a full sentence using user input
- Counts total characters in the sentence
- Counts the number of spaces
- Counts non-space characters (letters and symbols)

## Concepts Used
- `std::string`
- `getline` for reading full input lines
- `for` loops
- Conditional logic
- Basic counters and variables
- Console input/output

## How to Run

Compile:

`g++ main.cpp -o string-analyzer`

## Run

`./string-analyzer`

## Purpose

This mini project is part of my C++ learning journey and focuses on building small, beginner-friendly programs to practice core C++ fundamentals.
