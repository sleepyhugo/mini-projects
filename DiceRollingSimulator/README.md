# 🎲 Dice Rolling Simulator (C++)

A simple command-line dice rolling simulator written in C++.  
This project was built to practice random number generation, loops, and user input handling.

## Features
- Roll any number of dice
- Choose how many sides each die has
- Displays each roll and the total
- Option to roll again without restarting the program

## Concepts Used
- Random number generation (`rand`, `srand`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- User input/output
- Basic input validation
- State tracking (roll total)

## How to Run

Compile:

`g++ main.cpp -o dice`
### Run

`./dice`

## Purpose

This mini project is part of my C++ learning journey and focuses on building small, complete programs that demonstrate steady progress and understanding of core C++ fundamentals.
